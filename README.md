## List of files and their contents
* `blog_anomaly_detection.ipynb` Contains the bulk of visualisation and data generation code.
* `prophet_bonus.ipynb` Contains the bonus content using [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)
* `/images` Contains all the images generated from scripts in above notebooks.

## Setup
In order to run the repo, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and then run: `poetry install`.
Prophet will have to be installed separately since as of time of writing my computer refused to cooperate with
Prophet and I ran that code in google colab.
